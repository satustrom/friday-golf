They may not obscure your vision fully, as the nose of the fish must be pointing at the nose of the player  If you are afraid of fish, this can be a plant instead (or another object of your choosing)",

  5: "You must hit the ball twice to get it into the hole.  Your first hit must not score the point, and should move the ball.  On your second hit, you may try and score a point.",
  6: "You take your shot and then decide who to inverse your points with.  For example, if you get 5 points, they get -5, and if you get -10, they get 10.  One person can receive multiple people's points.  If no one chooses you to receive points, you get 0.  You cannot choose yourself.",

For example, if you score 10 points, whoever you choose looses 10 points (and you don't get any).  If you score -10, the other person still looses 10 points.  One person can loose points from multiple people's.  If no one chooses you to receive points, you get 0.  You cannot choose yourself.",

  12: "Congrats! Whatever points you get are doubled.  Remember, if you get a negative number, this will mean you lose even more points.  For example, if you score 5 points, this will be doubled to 10.  If you score -5, this will be doubled to -10.  If you get 0, that's still 0.",
  13: "There are three balls on the green at once.  You get one hit to hit all three balls at once, and you will get points from all of them. For example if one is a miss and two goes to the small hole - you will get small hole points x2 and miss points x1.",
  14: "You stand 3 feet away from the golf course.  You have 5 seconds to walk over and take your shot.  If you do not hit the ball before the time is up, it is counted as a miss.  If you hit the ball before the time are up, then all is normal."
