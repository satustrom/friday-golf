They may not obscure your vision fully, as the nose of the fish must be pointing at the nose of the player  If you are afraid of fish, this can be a plant instead (or another object of your choosing)",
  1: "You must use the handle of the golf club to hit the ball, and hold the 'club' end.",
  2: "The player before you gets your points. The first player of the round gives his/her points for the last.",
  3: "The player after you gets your points. Last player of the round gives his/her points for the first.",
  4: "You take your shot and then decide who you give your points to.  One person can receive multiple people's points.  If no one chooses you to receive points, you get 0.  You cannot choose yourself.",
  5: "You must hit the ball twice to get it into the hole.  Your first hit must not score the point, and should move the ball.  On your second hit, you may try and score a point.",
  6: "You take your shot and then decide who to inverse your points with.  For example, if you get 5 points, they get -5, and if you get -10, they get 10.  One person can receive multiple people's points.  If no one chooses you to receive points, you get 0.  You cannot choose yourself.",

For example, if you score 10 points, whoever you choose looses 10 points (and you don't get any).  If you score -10, the other person still looses 10 points.  One person can loose points from multiple people's.  If no one chooses you to receive points, you get 0.  You cannot choose yourself.",
  10: "You name which hole you are aiming for.  If you get it, double points.  If you get another hole, it's 0-points.  If you miss, it's the same as a miss.",
  11: "You take 2 shots and get the highest value",
  12: "Congrats! Whatever points you get are doubled.  Remember, if you get a negative number, this will mean you lose even more points.  For example, if you score 5 points, this will be doubled to 10.  If you score -5, this will be doubled to -10.  If you get 0, that's still 0.",
  13: "There are three balls on the green at once.  You get one hit to hit all three balls at once, and you will get points from all of them. For example if one is a miss and two goes to the small hole - you will get small hole points x2 and miss points x1.",
  14: "You stand 3 feet away from the golf course.  You have 5 seconds to walk over and take your shot.  If you do not hit the ball before the time is up, it is counted as a miss.  If you hit the ball before the time are up, then all is normal.",
  15: "Instead of the regular club and ball, you use the mini club and ball, with the same holes.",
  16: "Choose a golf buddy - you both get the same score.  Both people take their shot and the mean average is the score.  For example, if person 1 gets 10, and person 2 gets 2, then both get 6.  If you do not have a partner, you must join a pair and the mean average is taken of those 3 scores.",

They can be nominated by choosing a random number, group vote, free-style rap contest, or other method.  Any disputes about anything (golf related or otherwise) or confusion is decided by this person - their word is final for the round.  The round ends once the 'randomize' button has been pressed for the final shot of the round.",

  20: "You nominate someone else to take your shot for you on your turn.  You get whatever points they score.  If someone isn't moniated, they get zero points.  One person can be nominated by multiple players.",

  22: "Instead of using the golf club, you use your foot to get the ball in the hole. The ball must still start between the unicorn's legs.",
